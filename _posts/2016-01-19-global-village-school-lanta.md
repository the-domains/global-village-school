Global Village School is the only licenced International School on Koh Lanta located across from the Electric Office on the main street.    Global Village is currently educating children (aged 1.5 to 12 years old) .

Global Village School focuses on developing strong foundations in social, emotional, physical and intellectual development.  Our goal is to develop global citizens who can demonstrate leadership, thoughtfulness, resourcefulness and insight.  

We believe that the sooner children start developing foundation skills, the better their chances of success.  We believe in challenging students at a level that is appropriate for them and comparing them to a core set of expectations rather than to other children.
